## Equipment Set-up and Testing

A typical live broadcast uses equipment like the following:
- Camera(s)
- Microphone(s)
- Mixing and production equipment, often software running on a computer
- Encoding software or hardware

All this equipment needs to be purchased, configured, and set up. You also need to account for accessories like cables, batteries, and so on. Once you have all your equipment set up, you want to test thoroughly. No one wants to have their live video stream interrupted because somebody tripped over a cable!

Test your cameras, microphones, and encoders. Then, ensure that your whole setup works well together. We recommend running a test stream several days in advance of your main event, if possible. Make sure it works for viewers, as well.

## Embedding on websites and social media
Embedding is simply the process of putting a video player directly on a given web page. This can also be done on various social networks.

Embedding maximizes your audience by capturing and drawing in people who already frequent your websites and social media pages.

It’s easy to embed a live stream. Generally, it simply involves copying an “embed code” from your OVP backend. From there, you can insert this code into your website using a code view or code editor. Embedding is a simple, yet key, element in the success of any live video stream.

Some platforms like YouTube have their own rules for embedding live streams.
